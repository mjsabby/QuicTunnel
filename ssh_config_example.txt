# Example SSH config file (~/.ssh/config)
# This shows how to configure SSH to use QuicTunnelClient as a ProxyCommand

# Target machine accessible through QuicTunnel
Host my-remote-machine
    # The hostname doesn't matter since the connection will go through the tunnel
    # It's used for identification in the tunnel system
    HostName my-remote-machine
    User your-username
    
    # Path to the QuicTunnelClient executable
    # On Windows, use the full path with .exe extension
    ProxyCommand /path/to/QuicTunnelClient
    
    # Standard SSH options
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    
    # You can add multiple target machines, just use different Host entries
    # and make sure the proper identification is set up in the tunnel system

# Example with additional parameters (if implemented)
# Host another-machine
#    HostName another-machine
#    User another-username
#    ProxyCommand /path/to/QuicTunnelClient --target another-machine
